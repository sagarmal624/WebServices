HATEOAS stands for “Hypermedia as the engine of application state”
What do you see when you visit a web page?

The data that you would want to see. Is that all? You would also see links and buttons to see related data.

For example, if you go to a student page, you will see

Student profile
Links to Edit and Delete Student details
Links to see details of other students
Link to see details of the courses and grades of the student
HATEOAS brings the same concepts to RESTful Web Services.

When some details of a resource are requested, you will provide the resource details as well as details of related resources and the possible actions you can perform on the resource.
